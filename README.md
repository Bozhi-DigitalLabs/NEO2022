# NEO2022
New Energy Obersivation(NEO2022) program is created by Bo-zhi Digital Labs, an non-porfit origrization from China. 
We focuses on the life-cycle data/information/knowledge share of the renewable energy (PV, Hydrogen, Li-ion Battery, Wind Power, etc.) with the general public. 
Our mission Includes the share of supply-chain-data, tech-data, and the life-cycle carbon emission data with the general public. 
We believe that by visualization and make public of the renewable-energyâ€™s life-cycle data, the energy world can be changed.
